# 🚦 Predict Traffic Congestion

This project predicts traffic congestion using machine learning techniques. By analyzing real-world data — such as time, weather, and location — it forecasts congestion levels to support smarter traffic management.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Analyze historical traffic data to discover congestion patterns.
- Engineer features like peak hours, location clusters, and weather effects.
- Train models to classify or regress traffic congestion levels.
- Expose predictions via an API or visualization dashboard.
- Provide scalable deployment via Docker or cloud services.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Collection**
   - Traffic APIs (Google Maps, INRIX, TomTom)
   - City open datasets
   - Weather APIs (OpenWeatherMap, NOAA)

2. **Preprocessing**
   - Missing value handling
   - Time & date feature extraction
   - Location clustering
   - Weather integration

3. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**
   - Congestion vs. time of day
   - Correlation between weather and traffic
   - Location-based density plots

4. **Modeling**
   - Algorithms: Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM (optional)
   - Metrics: RMSE, R², Accuracy, F1-score

5. **Deployment**
   - FastAPI/Flask REST API
   - Dockerized container for scalable deployment
   - Optional: Streamlit dashboard
